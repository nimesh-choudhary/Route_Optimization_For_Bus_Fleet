## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
